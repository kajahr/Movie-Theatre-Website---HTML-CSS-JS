        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt uDecide what level you are
        This isn’t easy, because it involves a genuine ability to evaluate your skills and experience then decide where you fit in among your peers.
        
        Our industry sometimes has a tendency to say that someone with more than three years of experience is “senior”, but I try to break it down to a more fine-grained level than that. As much as I hate using “years of experience” as a prediction of success, here’s a rough guide just to get us started:
        
        If you have under one year of experience, you’re looking for an entry-level role.
        If you have fewer than three years of experience, most people would classify you as a junior developer.
        If you have between three and five years of experience, most people would classify you as a mid-range developer.
        If you have over five years of experience, you might be called a senior developer, but at the same time you might just be called an experienced mid-range developer.
        Applying for entry-level roles
        Make no mistake: applying for an entry-level role can be one of the hardest things you’ll ever do. Not only do most entry-level developers lack confidence in whatever skills they have, but they also don’t have much idea where their abilities fit in compared to others.
        
        So, first I want to re-assure you that if you’re really stressed out about finding your first app development job, or if you’ve been applying to places for months and have yet to make any progress: you’re not alone! It is hard to get your foot on the ladder, and as long as you’re still busy learning, coding, and applying for jobs, then you’re doing the right thing.
        
        Some tips to get you started:
        
        Having a portfolio of work is important. This can feel like a chicken and egg problem because it’s not possible to have a commercial portfolio without work, and you can’t get work without a portfolio, but try to break that cycle: put projects on GitHub that you made following Hacking with Swift, put projects on GitHub that you made in your spare time, put projects on GitHub that you forked from someone else and tweaked in interesting ways.
        Learn to interview well. Find a more senior developer than you, and ask if they could give you a mock interview. Your skills might be limited, but you need to learn to use them confidently!
        Try to attend some conferences. This helps you get a feel for what other developers are talking about, but is also a great way to build some contacts. Having friends in the right place is the easiest way to get your first experience – even if it’s just a six-week placement, that can be enough to help point you towards your job.
        Always be coding something. If you’ve been looking for a job for a few months it’s easy to get discouraged, but don’t let that stop you writing code. I can’t overstate how important it is to be able to point at GitHub and say, “this is how I spent the last few months.”
        Be flexible in what you apply for. If development jobs aren’t in plentiful supply near you, would you be happy applying for QA jobs? Keep in mind that’s it’s easier to switch jobs internally to a company than apply for them from the outside.
        Applying for junior roles
        Once you’re past the initial immersion into a commercial environment, you qualify as a junior developer and can start to think about the path upwards.
        
        By this point you should be familiar with all the non-coding aspects of being a developer: you’re happy using Git with a team, you’re happy filing and responding to issues in a system like Jira, you’re familiar with Scrum or some other agile process, you’re able to take part in code review in a meaningful way, and so on.
        
        When applying for junior jobs, I believe the issue of “experience” becomes more than a little fuzzy. Thinking purely in terms of Swift, no one has much experience. A lot of people – myself included – started learning Swift the very day it was announced, but even we can't lay claim to having more than a few years of experience.
        
        Mobile is of course different, because iOS has been around much longer than Swift. But you have to ask yourself: if you can demonstrate you're capable of independently making great apps, if you are indeed strong at solving general computing problems, and you have a genuine drive to succeed, would you really want to work for a company that says, "sure, you have all those things, but we need someone with more years on their résumé"?
        
        So, when you’re applying for junior roles there are a few things to take into account:
